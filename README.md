Web-Vim is an experiment I did to make the creation of HTML pages faster. The premise being that when I am usually prototyping with HTML and CSS, I know what I am writing and don't generally need to see my complete code or having the complete code context. What I want I just keep typing my code and keep seeing the result, quickly.

Hence, Web-Vim. It allows you to quickly prototype web pages just using commands and usual CSS syntax, without ever leaving your keyboard!
